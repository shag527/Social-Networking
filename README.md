## Quick Installation

```
1. Go to root folder and start server by nodemon start
2. Go to client folder and start client by npm start
```

After this, open [http://localhost:3000/signin](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.


## Requirements and Configuration

Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine

By default, the app uses MongoDB hosted on [mLab](https://mlab.com/) and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) CDN for hosting images. We have created a demo user for mLab and Cloudinary so you can run the app locally without adding Mongo URL and Cloudinary API Key, however when you start developing your application it is recommended to replace that information with your own, so that everyone has their own Database and CDN.


### Replacing Mongo URL

Replace `MONGO_URL` value in `api/.env` file with your `mLab` database url or with local one.

### Replacing Cloudinary API Key

Grab `Cloud name` `API Key` and `API Secret` from Cloudinary dashboard and replace corresponding values inside `api/.env` file.

### Mail Provider

For password reset functionality you will need to replace Email Provider values also in `api/.env` file.
